# Buvvs
Buff Frame Customizer. An ace 3 addon to move buff frames around splits debut from the main buffs frame for more freedom of placement. I used the majority of the code from an old addon called wisest which is based on bisons code. Slash command is /by. There are more than likely some issues but I haven't had time to really run it through it's paces.
