# Buvvs
Buff Frame Customizer. An ace 3 addon to move buff frames around and splits the main buffs frame for more freedom of placement. Based on Bison. Slash command is /bv. There are more than likely some issues but I haven't had time to really run it through it's paces, and I can't possibly test all circumstances or environments alone.
